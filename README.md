# Task Manager

## Overview
Task Manager is a mobile application built using Swift and SwiftUI, integrated with CoreData. It serves as a practice project for implementing Core Data with MVVM architecture. The app enables users to manage their tasks directly on their mobile device. Users can add, delete, update tasks, and even share them with other applications. Task Manager adds a creative touch by assigning a random color and a random rotating angle to each new task, giving it a unique visual identity.

## Features
1. **Add Task**: Users can easily add new tasks to their task list.
2. **Delete Task**: Users can delete tasks by tapping the trash icon.
3. **Update Task**: Users have the flexibility to edit and update task details as needed.
4. **Share Task**: Tasks can be shared with other applications, facilitating collaboration and communication.
5. **Dynamic Visuals**: Each new task is assigned a random color and a random rotating angle, making the task management experience visually engaging.

## MVVM Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. MVVM separates the presentation logic from the business logic by introducing a ViewModel layer. This architecture promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability of the codebase, making it ideal for managing tasks efficiently.

## Usage
1. **Add Task**: Tap the "+" button to add a new task. Enter the task details and tap "Create".
2. **Delete Task**: Tap the trash icon next to the task to delete it.
3. **Update Task**: Tap on a task to edit its details. Make the desired changes and tap "Update".
4. **Share Task**: Tap on a task to view its details. Tap the share icon to share the task with other applications.
